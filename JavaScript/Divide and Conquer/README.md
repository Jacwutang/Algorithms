1. binarySearch.js

Task. The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛 and a sequence 𝑎0 < 𝑎1 < . . . < 𝑎𝑛−1 of
𝑛 pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. The next line contains an integer 𝑘 and 𝑘
positive integers 𝑏0, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑘−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛, 𝑘 ≤ 105; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛; 1 ≤ 𝑏𝑗 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑗 < 𝑘;

Output Format. For all 𝑖 from 0 to 𝑘 − 1, output an index 0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 such that 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑏𝑖 or −1 if there
is no such index

2. majorityElement.js
Task. The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element.

Input Format. The first line contains an integer 𝑛, the next one contains a sequence of 𝑛 non-negative
integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105

Output Format. Output 1 if the sequence contains an element that appears strictly more than 𝑛/2 times,
and 0 otherwise

3. quickSort.js
Task. To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with
few unique elements, your goal is replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. That is, your new
partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < 𝑥 part, = 𝑥 part, and > 𝑥 part.

Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛. The next line contains a sequence of 𝑛
integers 𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105
; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109
for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.

Output Format. Output this sequence sorted in non-decreasing order

4. mergeSort_inversions.js
Task. The goal in this problem is to count the number of inversions of a given sequence.

Input Format. The first line contains an integer 𝑛, the next one contains a sequence of integers

Output Format. Output the number of inversions in the sequence.
