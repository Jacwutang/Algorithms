1. binarySearch.js

Task. The goal in this code problem is to implement the binary search algorithm.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑛 and a sequence 𝑎0 < 𝑎1 < . . . < 𝑎𝑛−1 of
𝑛 pairwise distinct positive integers in increasing order. The next line contains an integer 𝑘 and 𝑘
positive integers 𝑏0, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑘−1.

Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛, 𝑘 ≤ 105; 1 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛; 1 ≤ 𝑏𝑗 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑗 < 𝑘;

Output Format. For all 𝑖 from 0 to 𝑘 − 1, output an index 0 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛 − 1 such that 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑏𝑖 or −1 if there
is no such index
