<h2> primitiveCalculator.js </h2>
Introduction: You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number
x: multiply x by 2, multiply x by 3, or add 1 to x. Your goal is given a positive integer n, find the
minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n starting from the number 1.

Task. Given an integer n, compute the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n
starting from the number 1.

Input Format. The input consists of a single integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 106

Output Format. In the first line, output the minimum number k of operations needed to get n from 1.
In the second line output a sequence of intermediate numbers. That is, the second line should contain the sequence to get to n

<h2> knapsackDP.js </h2>

This problem is about implementing an algorithm for the knapsack without repetitions problem.
Problem Description

Task. In this problem, you are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible
into your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence
you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

Input Format. The first line of the input contains the capacity W of a knapsack and the number n of bars
of gold. The next line contains n integers w0, w1, . . . , wn−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

Output Format. Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity W.

<h2> stringEditDistance.js </h2>
Introduction: The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and mismatches in an alignment of two strings.

Task. The goal of this problem is to implement the algorithm for computing the edit distance between two
strings.

Input Format. Each of the two lines of the input contains a string consisting of lower case latin letters.

Constraints. The length of both strings is at least 1 and at most 100.

Output Format. Output the edit distance between the given two strings

<h2> placingParenthesis.js </h2>
In this problem, your goal is to add parentheses to a given arithmetic expression to maximize its value.

Task. Find the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic
operations using additional parentheses.

Input Format. The only line of the input contains a string s of length 2n + 1 for some n, with symbols
s0; s1; : : : ; s2n. Each symbol at an even position of s is a digit (that is, an integer from 0 to 9) while
each symbol at an odd position is one of three operations from {+,-,*}.


Output Format. Output the maximum possible value of the given arithmetic expression among different
orders of applying arithmetic operations.

<h2> longestCommonSubsequence </h2>
In this problem, the goal is to compute the length of a longest common subsequence of three sequences
