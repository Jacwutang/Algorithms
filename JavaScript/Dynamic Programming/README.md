1. primitiveCalculator.js
Introduction: You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number
x: multiply x by 2, multiply x by 3, or add 1 to x. Your goal is given a positive integer n, find the
minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n starting from the number 1.

Task. Given an integer n, compute the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number n
starting from the number 1.

Input Format. The input consists of a single integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 106

Output Format. In the first line, output the minimum number k of operations needed to get n from 1.
In the second line output a sequence of intermediate numbers. That is, the second line should contain the sequence to get to n

2. knapsackDP.js

This problem is about implementing an algorithm for the knapsack without repetitions problem.
Problem Description

Task. In this problem, you are given a set of bars of gold and your goal is to take as much gold as possible
into your bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence
you cannot take a fraction of a bar).

Input Format. The first line of the input contains the capacity W of a knapsack and the number n of bars
of gold. The next line contains n integers w0, w1, . . . , wn−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

Output Format. Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity W.
